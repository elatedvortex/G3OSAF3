🛰️ GEOSAFE – A Place to Be Safe

GEOSAFE is a community-driven mobile app that helps users stay aware of crime activity in their surroundings.
It allows users to report nearby incidents, visualize unsafe zones on an interactive OpenStreetMap, and receive alerts when entering high-risk areas.

⚙️ Features

🧭 Live Crime Map: Displays reported incidents on OpenStreetMap.

🚨 Instant Alerts: Warns users when entering unsafe areas.

📝 Crime Reporting: Users can quickly report crimes with location and details.

🔥 Heatmap View: Highlights danger-prone zones based on report density.

🧠 How It Works
The app continuously tracks the user’s location and displays real-time crime data stored locally on the device.
Users can contribute by reporting incidents, which are immediately reflected on the map.
When the user enters a high-risk zone, the app automatically sends an in-app alert to ensure awareness and safety.
